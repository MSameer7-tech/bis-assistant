# Phase 12.A.2: Embedding Environment Provisioning and Validation

## Decision
`PHASE_12_A2_STATUS: FAIL`

## Environment
- **macOS version**: 27.0
- **CPU architecture**: arm64
- **Python version**: 3.14.4
- **Active virtual environment**: `scratch/venv` (Re-created with Python 3.9 from `/usr/bin/python3`)
- **pip version**: 26.0.1 (upgraded)

## Provisioning Attempts
1. **Attempt 1 (Standard PyTorch + Sentence Transformers)**: Failed. PyTorch (127MB) timed out repeatedly.
2. **Attempt 2 (Correct architecture-specific)**: Failed. Same timeout issues on ARM64 wheels.
3. **Attempt 3 (Compatible package-version adjustment)**: 
   Recreated virtual environment using Python 3.9 (as Python 3.14 lacks prebuilt wheels). 
   PyPI download of `transformers` (12MB) still stalled completely and timed out due to severe DNS/connection failures: `NewConnectionError: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided`.
4. **Attempt 4 (ONNX CPU backend / Lightweight fallback)**:
   Attempted to install `onnxruntime` and `tokenizers` directly on Python 3.9 to avoid PyTorch and Transformers.
   `onnxruntime` (16.8MB) repeatedly timed out and failed to download due to identical DNS/connection failures.
5. **Attempt 5 (Result)**: 
   All technically reasonable local installation routes failed because the environment consistently blocks/times out multi-megabyte package downloads.

## Selected Model
- **Embedding model**: Intended `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (compact, deterministic, sufficient for semantic testing).
- **Model revision**: NONE
- **Embedding dimension**: 384
- **Distance metric recommendation**: Cosine Similarity
- **Normalization**: L2 Normalization required for Cosine Similarity.
- **Local path**: NONE (Download blocked).

## Offline Verification
- **Test Results**: FAILED. The offline execution could not be tested because the dependencies could not be successfully provisioned.

## Determinism
- **Test Results**: FAILED.

## Immutability Verification
- **v22 unchanged**: YES (`68229fbe37078b6571da7a0b71747fd4b5b383f232b796c71ae6e773c0c13dbe`)
- **Phase 12.2 unchanged**: YES (`c91c1f0a46f235ff64738c9e1ea1fecedf9078b94076779ffd1635d95b068486`)
- **Phase 12.3 unchanged**: YES
- **BM25 unchanged**: YES (`4d6a07b644b5a9d172ee5c7acd34ff017746aaf58321424f462908ba87a54df6`)

## Exact Limitations
- Persistent DNS resolution failures and network timeouts (`[Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided` / `ReadTimeoutError`) unconditionally block the download of any multi-megabyte Python package (`torch`, `transformers`, `onnxruntime`, etc.). This renders the provisioning of a local semantic vector backend impossible without bypassing the strict "no hosted API" rule.
